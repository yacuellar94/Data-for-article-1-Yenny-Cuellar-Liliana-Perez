(A) Reference data: raster land-cover maps of the study area in Bogota, Colombia. Pixel values are 1) constructions, 2) crops and pastures, 3)quarries, 4) urban green spaces, 5) water, and 6) wetlands.

1) ref2004_5m&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Reference 2004 with 5 meters resolution.
2) ref2010_5m&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Reference 2010 with 5 metres resolution.
3) ref2004_30m&emsp;&emsp;Reference 2004 with 30 meters resolution.
4) ref2010_30m&emsp;&emsp;Reference 2010 with 30 metres resolution.

(B) Model outputs: Maps showing the land-cover projection for 2010 with different spatial resolutions 3 x 3, 5 x 5, and 7 x 7 neighborhood sizes.

5) sim2010_5m3x&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Simulated map 5 metres resolution with 3 x 3 neighbourhood size.
6) sim2010_5m5x&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Simulated map 5 metres resolution with 5 x 5 neighbourhood size.
7) sim2010_5m7x&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Simulated map 5 metres resolution with 7 x 7 neighbourhood size.
